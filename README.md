# NFL Game Spread Modeling
## Overview
This repository contains code for modeling NFL game spreads using historical data from the past 15 NFL seasons. The project aims to analyze and predict point spreads in NFL games using various statistical and machine learning approaches.
## What is a Spread?
In NFL betting and analysis, the spread (or point spread) is the predicted scoring differential between two teams in a game. For example, if Team A is favored by 7 points over Team B, the spread would be written as:
- Team A -7.0
- Team B +7.0
This means:
- If Team A wins by more than 7 points, they "cover" the spread
- If Team B loses by less than 7 points (or wins), they "cover" the spread
- If Team A wins by exactly 7 points, it's a "push"
